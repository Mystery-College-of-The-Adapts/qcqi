Grover's Search Algorithm
=========================

I am working on simulating Grover's search algorithm. The program is to accept the following as inputs:
• The number of qubits, N
• The number of targets, M
• The list of targets, T, any one of which is a valid result of the search operation

The program should then choose an appropriate number of iterations of the Grover's iterator, simulate the action of algorithm and provide an answer.
The program should be able to display:
• The state |\psi\rangle of the system after each iteration
• The amplitude plot and the probability of collapsing into one of the target states at the i^{th} iteration
• Possibly a graphical display showing how |\psi\rangle is moving between |t\rangle and |t^{\perp}\rangle, where |t\rangle is the uniform superposition of all the target states and |t^{\perp}\rangle is the superposition of all non-target states.
